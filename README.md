*Task 3 - REAL-TIME-COLLABORATIVE-DOCUMENT-EDITOR:
This task involves developing a real-time collaborative document editor similar to Google Docs, enabling multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously. The frontend is built using React.js integrated with the Quill rich-text editor for smooth text formatting and editing features such as headings, lists, bold, and italic styles. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO to handle bi-directional communication, ensuring instant synchronization of text changes across all connected clients without overwriting existing content. The project features a clean, responsive interface styled with simple CSS for better usability. Development and testing were carried out using Visual Studio Code, and the project was version-controlled and hosted on GitHub for easy demonstration and submission.*
